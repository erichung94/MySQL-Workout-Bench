## Future Development & Bugs to be fixed

- [ ] If user puts in duplicate email, alert them.
- [ ] Make sure user is putting in an image into the update image URL. If not, return error message.
- [ ] Allow users to only input gyms into location search.
- [ ] Require user to choose a gender on sign up page.
- [ ] Fool proof the display function and notify users if there is no match available.
- [ ] Boost logic with better time categories (perhaps using google calendar api).
- [ ] Have logic drill down further & let the users input more detailed workouts for matches (especially for weight lifting).
- [ ] Maybe have logic only spit out match for that particular activity/time/location the user chooses instead of matching their whole history.
- [ ] Allow users to delete prior interest entries.
- [ ] Fix up location logic so users don't have to match exactly to other users, but can match based on a certain radius.
- [ ] Develop the app so users can contact each other in chat instead of emailing each other.
