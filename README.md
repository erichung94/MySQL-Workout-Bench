## Future Development & Bugs to be fixed

- [ ] If user puts in duplicate email, alert them.
- [ ] Allow users to only input gyms into location search.
- [ ] Boost logic with better time categories (perhaps using google calendar api).
- [ ] Make sure user is putting in an image into the update image URL. If not, return error message.
- [ ] Have logic drill down further & let the users input more detailed workouts for matches (especially for weight lifting).
